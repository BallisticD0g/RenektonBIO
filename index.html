            The story of Renekton begins with his younger brother, Nasus, who was a renowned scholar and astronomer in the empire
            Nasus discovered that the empire's time was running out, and that a great disaster was coming that would destroy everything.
            He convinced his brother Renekton to join him in helping to save the empire.

            Together, the two brothers worked tirelessly to prepare for the disaster. They built a massive labyrinth beneath 
            the empire's capital city, filled with powerful magical artifacts that they hoped would protect the people from 
            the coming destruction. But as the disaster approached, Renekton began to lose his mind to the dark magic they were using.

            When the disaster finally struck, the city was destroyed and the empire fell. Renekton was lost in the labyrinth for centuries,
            driven mad by the dark magic that had consumed him. When he finally emerged, he was a twisted, brutal shadow of his former self, 
            filled with rage and a thirst for blood.
